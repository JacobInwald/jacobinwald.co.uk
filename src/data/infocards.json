I got my first Raspberry Pi at 9 and I have not stopped programming since, learning C++ and Java to create games and Python to sketch out programming concepts. I find that problem-solving is the most enjoyable and stimulating way to apply myself and I believe that the diversity of my project focuses shows this. I excel in high-pressure and dynamic environments, as I have had to vie for excellence in many such environments - evidenced by my competitive experience in climbing."
